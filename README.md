# Dream Small

A flutter-project, that's the first for [@BrownieMaar](https://github.com/BrownieMaar/).

## About the project

The project is based on another project of mine, which was written in React. This version of the project came to be because an opportunity came up, and for that opportunity Flutter was a requirement. So I decided to rewrite the project in Flutter.

## Getting Started

For information on how to start the application in development mode, please go to the [flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) on how to set up and use flutter. Then run the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
flutter run
```

## About the Game

The game is a simple game, where every player has to pick a previously agreed upon amount of natural numbers, that are greater than 0. The winner is the player, who picked the lowest number, that no other player picked.
